# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

OpenVAS-Tracker is a vulnerability management dashboard built in Go with an embedded React SPA. It receives OpenVAS and OWASP ZAP scan results via webhook, tracks vulnerabilities per host/URL, and manages remediation through automated ticketing. Multi-scanner architecture with pluggable parsers. No active scanning — purely a results viewer and ticket tracker. Licensed under GPL v3.

make build-linux  # cross-compile for Linux amd64
make test         # go test ./...
make clean        # remove build artifacts

# Docker
docker compose up -d          # start MariaDB + app
docker compose down -v        # stop and remove volumes
docker compose build app      # rebuild app image

# Database

make migrate-down  # rollback one migration
```

## Architecture

**Layered Go backend:** `cmd/openvas-tracker/main.go` wires everything together.

```
handler (Echo HTTP) → service (business logic) → queries (database/sql) → MariaDB
                                                → scanner (XML/JSON parsers)
                                                → report (html/pdf/excel/md)
```

- **`internal/handler/`** — Echo route handlers. Each has a `RegisterRoutes(*echo.Group)` method.
  - `auth.go` — Login (no registration). Admin + LDAP + DB fallback. By username.
  - `import.go` — Thin adapter → `ImportService`. `POST /openvas` (XML), `POST /zap` (JSON), `GET /openvas` triggers fetch script.
  - `tickets.go` — CRUD, status, comments, activity, bulk ops, risk rule creation. Validated via `c.Validate()`. Detail page shows prominent CVSS score box.
  - `scans.go` — List/Get + diff endpoint.
  - `settings.go` — Setup guide, user list, .env read/write, LDAP test, risk rules.
  - `pagination.go` — `paginate(c)` → `(limit, offset int32)`. Default 500, max 5000.
- **`internal/service/`** — Business logic.
  - `import.go` — Transaction-wrapped import: scan+vulns+tickets, risk rule matching, auto-resolve, PTR hostname backfill.
  - `ldap.go` — AD auth, group membership check, member listing.
  - `envfile.go` — Read/write `.env` for Settings UI.
- **`internal/database/queries/`** — Hand-written SQL. `db.go` defines `DBTX` interface (accepts `*sql.DB` and `*sql.Tx`).
- **`internal/scanner/`** — Multi-scanner parser package.
  - `scanner.go` — `Finding` struct (scanner-agnostic) + `ScanMeta` (optional scan timestamps) + `Parser` interface + `Fingerprint()` method.
  - `openvas.go` — `ParseOpenVASXML`: CVE from `<refs><ref type="cve">` and `<nvt><cve>`, hostname from `<host><hostname>`. Returns `([]Finding, *ScanMeta, error)`. Extracts `scan_start`/`scan_end` from GMP XML for accurate scan timestamps.
  - `zap.go` — `ParseZAPJSON`: ZAP Traditional JSON Report. Each alert instance → one Finding. Uses `@host`/`@port`/`@ssl` keys. Strips HTML from desc/solution. Maps riskcode 3→high, 2→medium, 1→low, 0→info (skipped). Default CVSS: 7.0/4.0/2.0/0.0.
- **`internal/report/`** — HTML, PDF (maroto v2), Excel (excelize), Markdown generators.
- **`internal/middleware/`** — JWT auth, API key auth (timing-safe), rate limiting, security headers.

**Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + Tailwind, embedded via `//go:embed all:static` in `cmd/openvas-tracker/frontend.go`.

## Configuration

All via `.env` file (`godotenv` + `os.Getenv`). Editable via Settings page. Auto-detects `/etc/openvas-tracker/env` on production, override with `OT_ENV_FILE`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OT_SERVER_PORT` | 8080 | HTTP listen port |
| `OT_DATABASE_DSN` | `...@tcp(localhost:3306)/openvas-tracker?parseTime=true` | MariaDB DSN |
| `OT_JWT_SECRET` | (none — **required**, min 32 chars) | JWT signing key |
| `OT_IMPORT_APIKEY` | (empty) | Import webhook API key (min 32 chars) |
| `OT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | (empty) | Admin user password (username: `admin`) |
| `OT_AUTORESOLVE_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Consecutive scans without finding before auto-resolve |
| `OT_LDAP_URL` | (empty) | e.g. `ldaps://dc01.example.com:636` |
| `OT_LDAP_BASE_DN` | (empty) | LDAP base DN |
| `OT_LDAP_BIND_DN` | (empty) | LDAP service account DN |
| `OT_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD` | (empty) | LDAP service account password |
| `OT_LDAP_GROUP_DN` | (empty) | Required group DN for access |
| `OT_LDAP_USER_FILTER` | `(sAMAccountName=%s)` | LDAP user search filter |

## Database

- **MariaDB** with `database/sql` + `go-sql-driver/mysql`
- 20 migrations in `sql/migrations/` (001-020). `sql/docker-init.sql` sources all.
- **Auto-migrate on startup** — `AutoMigrate` applies pending migrations automatically when the app starts. Bootstraps `schema_migrations` for existing databases. Bootstrap only marks CREATE TABLE migrations as applied — ALTER TABLE migrations always run.
- UUIDs are `CHAR(36)`, generated in Go (`uuid.New().String()`)
- Pool: `MaxOpenConns`, `MaxIdleConns`, `ConnMaxLifetime(5m)`, `ConnMaxIdleTime(3m)`

## Key Patterns

### Auth
- Login by username, three sources in order: (1) admin + `OT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, (2) LDAP bind + group check, (3) DB user fallback. No registration. Rate limited 30/min/IP.
- LDAP re-reads `.env` on each login for live config changes. Auto-creates DB user on first LDAP login. LDAP group members are also auto-created (with real UUIDs) when the user list is loaded, so they can be assigned to tickets before first login. Users without email are skipped.
- No roles — all users have equal access. Role column exists but is never checked.

### Import
- OpenVAS/ZAP webhook → `ImportService.Import(ctx, []Finding, scanType, *ScanMeta)` → single transaction: scan + vulns + tickets.
- `Finding` struct is scanner-agnostic. `ParseOpenVASXML` returns `([]Finding, *ScanMeta, error)` — `ScanMeta` carries `scan_start`/`scan_end` from the GMP XML report so the scan record gets the original scan timestamps instead of the import time. `ParseZAPJSON` returns `([]Finding, error)` — ZAP reports don't include scan timestamps, so `nil` meta is passed and `time.Now()` is used.
- **Fingerprinting** (dedup key per finding):
  - Network findings (OpenVAS): CVE or `"title:" + title`. Key: `(host, fingerprint)`.
  - Web findings (ZAP): `"cwe:" + cweid + ":url:" + urlPath + ":param:" + param` — only when parameter is present. Falls back to `"title:" + title + ":url:" + urlPath + ":param:" + param` if no CWE. CVE always takes priority if present.
  - **Server-wide findings** (no parameter, e.g. missing headers): `"cwe:" + cweid` or `"title:" + title` — one ticket per host, not per URL. All affected URLs shown in ticket detail via `AffectedURLsByPeer` query.
- Per vuln: check risk accept rules → find ticket by fingerprint (host + CVE/title/CWE+URL) → create/reopen/touch → auto-resolve stale → commit.
- **Auto-resolve scoped by scan type** — a ZAP scan only auto-resolves ZAP tickets, never OpenVAS tickets and vice versa. Uses `(host, scan_type)` scope via `scan_hosts` table (migration 018).
- PTR hostname backfill runs async after each import. Hostnames normalized: `UPPERCASE.domain.lowercase`.

### Tickets
- Statuses: `open` → `pending_resolution` (after 1+ scan miss) → `fixed` (after N consecutive misses, configurable via `OT_AUTORESOLVE_THRESHOLD`, default 3) | `risk_accepted` | `false_positive`. False positives never reopened.
- Flapping protection: findings not present in a scan increment `consecutive_misses` counter. After threshold consecutive misses, ticket auto-resolves to `fixed`. If finding reappears before threshold, counter resets and ticket returns to `open` with activity log. `pending_resolution` is visible in UI with amber badge.
- Risk accepted supports optional expiry date (auto-reopens when expired).
- All changes logged in `ticket_activity` with actor (user ID or "Automatic").
- Bulk: `POST /api/tickets/bulk` with `ticket_ids` + `status`/`assigned_to`.

### Risk Accept Rules
- `risk_accept_rules` table: fingerprint (CVE or `title:` + vuln title) + host pattern (`*` or IP).
- Created from ticket detail page ("this host" or "all hosts"). Applied to existing open and pending_resolution tickets on creation.
- Checked during import — matching new tickets auto-set to `risk_accepted`.
- "Refresh Tickets" button on Auto-Accept Rules page re-applies all rules to existing open and pending_resolution tickets (`POST /api/settings/risk-rules/apply`).

### Frontend
- `TableFilter` + `SortHeader` components on all list views. Search matches all visible columns. `FilterOption` supports `searchable: true` with `SelectOption[]` (`{value, label}`) for autocomplete combobox instead of plain `<select>`.
- Ticket list: checkbox bulk selection, default filter `status=open`, CVSS-sorted. Source filter (OpenVAS/ZAP). Host filter is a searchable combobox showing `IP (hostname)` — type to filter by IP or hostname.
- Scan list: scan type badges (OpenVAS green, ZAP blue) with type filter.
- Ticket detail: web finding details section (URL, parameter, evidence, confidence badges, CWE links) — only shown for ZAP findings. Server-wide findings show all affected URLs from peer vulnerabilities. Clicking the affected host navigates to the ticket list filtered by that host.
- Dashboard: open tickets by scan source pie chart (OpenVAS vs ZAP).
- Sidebar: Dashboard, My Tickets, All Tickets, Scans, Scan Diff, Auto-Accept Rules, Settings. GitHub repo link at bottom.
- Trend chart: 30-day daily snapshots of open tickets via recursive CTE.

## Deployment

Docker Compose or Debian Trixie systemd service. Use the `/deploy` skill for automated production deploys.

**Production:** Debian server accessible via SSH. Service runs as `openvas-tracker` user, config in `/etc/openvas-tracker/env`.

**GVM:** Greenbone CE Docker stack on production server. GMP socket at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/greenbone-community-edition_gvmd_socket_vol/_data/gvmd.sock`. Import triggered by GVM "HTTP Get" alert → `GET /api/import/openvas` → handler runs `sudo /usr/local/bin/openvas-tracker-fetch-latest` → script speaks GMP protocol directly to the socket (python3 stdlib only, no `gvm-tools` dependency), picks the task with the newest `last_report`, downloads the full XML report, POSTs it back to `/api/import/openvas`. Script source in `deploy/openvas-tracker-fetch-latest`, reads `OT_GMP_USER`/`OT_GMP_PASSWORD`/`OT_IMPORT_APIKEY` from `/etc/openvas-tracker/env`. Sudo is needed because `/var/lib/docker` is only traversable by root — sudoers rule in `deploy/openvas-tracker-sudoers`.

## Gotchas

- **No Redis, no active scanning, no registration** — import-only dashboard.
- **JWT secret required** — app refuses to start with default or short secret.
- **docker-init.sql** — must add `SOURCE` line when adding migrations.
- **DBTX interface** — `queries.New()` accepts `*sql.DB` and `*sql.Tx`. Use `*sql.Tx` in transactional flows.
- **Graceful shutdown** — handles SIGINT + SIGTERM (systemd/Docker).
- **Body limit** — global 5M with `Skipper` for `/api/import` (50M). `BodyLimitWithConfig` required — group-level limits can't override global.
- **GMP XML** — CVEs in `<refs><ref type="cve">`, not `<nvt><cve>`. Hostnames in `<host><hostname>` child element, IP is chardata.
- **Ticket title ≠ vuln title** — tickets formatted `[SEV] Title — Host`. Risk rules and dedup use raw vuln title.
- **MariaDB** — no FULL OUTER JOIN (use UNION ALL + NOT EXISTS), no `generate_series` (use `WITH RECURSIVE dates`).
- **Scan diff statuses** — `DiffScans` always runs `diffScansCompat` (the FULL OUTER JOIN path is dead — MariaDB has none). 7 statuses: `new`, `rediscovered`, `pending_fix`, `fixed`, `risk_accepted`, `host_unscanned`, `unchanged`. A finding in the new scan but not the old is downgraded from `new` to `host_unscanned` when the old scan never covered that host (`scan_hosts` check), or to `unchanged`/`risk_accepted`/`rediscovered` when a ticket created before the new scan already exists (mapped by ticket status). Legacy fallback: scans with zero `scan_hosts` rows skip the coverage check.
- **VulnTrend boundary** — counts tickets open at *end of day D*; both `created_at` and `resolved_at` comparisons must use `dates.d + INTERVAL 1 DAY`. A bare `dates.d` on `resolved_at` counts same-day resolutions as still-open (off-by-one).
- **tickets has no `affected_host`/`cve_id`** — both live on `vulnerabilities`; join `tickets t JOIN vulnerabilities v ON v.id = t.vulnerability_id`. Tolerate NULL `vulnerability_id` (orphans from the `ON DELETE SET NULL` FK).
- **SSH $ escaping** — passwords with `$` get shell-expanded. Use Python `chr(36)` or single-quoted heredoc.
- **Hostname normalization** — `normalizeHostname()`: UPPERCASE host, lowercase domain. Applied to imports + PTR.
- **ticketCols / qualifiedTicketCols / scanTicket** — these three must stay in sync when adding columns to `tickets` table. All are in `internal/database/queries/tickets.go`. Ticket queries JOIN vulnerabilities AND scans (for `scan_type` field).
- **ZAP JSON `@`-prefixed keys** — ZAP Traditional JSON Reports use `@host`, `@port`, `@ssl` (not `host`, `port`, `ssl`). The `zapSite` struct uses `json:"@host"` etc.
- **vulnCols / scanVuln** — must stay in sync with vulnerabilities table. Includes `url`, `parameter`, `evidence`, `confidence` (migration 020).
- **Backend-only features** — Teams (`/api/teams`) and Assets (`/api/assets`) have full backend handlers but no frontend UI beyond a read-only teams list.
- **git-filter-repo** — removes `origin` remote (re-add with `git remote add origin <url>`), resets working copy (uncommitted edits lost), and breaks tracking (`git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master`).
- **No DNS in import path** — `net.LookupAddr` stalls 12-18s per IP when any nameserver misbehaves; never call it inside the import transaction. Use `normalizeHostname(r.Hostname)` inline; let `BackfillHostnames` resolve missing ones async (48h positive / 1h negative cache, 3s per-lookup timeout — see `resolveHostname()` in `internal/service/import.go`).
- **GMP get_reports** — passing `format_id="a994b278-..."` (XML format) goes through a slow/broken report-format plugin in current GVM CE; omit `format_id` and the native response already arrives in the `<get_reports_response><report><report>...` envelope the parser expects. Filter `sort-reverse=date` is silently ignored due to default user filter — find the latest scan via `get_tasks → last_report`, not `get_reports`.
- **Two production import paths** — `GET /api/import/openvas` → `sudo openvas-tracker-fetch-latest` (primary, GVM HTTP-Get alert target) AND `openvas-tracker-import.timer` (oneshot watcher polling `/var/lib/openvas-tracker/incoming/*.xml`, legacy fallback). The watcher is harmless but redundant — don't rely on it.
- **Debugging a hung tracker handler** — enable mariadb general log (`SET GLOBAL general_log_file='/tmp/trace.log'; SET GLOBAL general_log=ON;`) to see which queries the goroutine actually issued (or didn't); `/proc/PID/io rchar` lies for Unix sockets — use `VmRSS` growth + cumulative `ps -p PID -o time` instead. Go binaries here have no pprof endpoint.
- **Release flow** — version source of truth is `frontend/package.json` (Go binary has no `var version` — the `-X main.version=…` ldflag in `release-deb.yml` is dead code). Bump it (and run `npm install --package-lock-only` so `package-lock.json` matches), commit, then `git tag -a vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` — the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release-deb.yml` which builds the .deb and publishes the GitHub Release. Tag and `package.json` should always match; check with `git tag --list | tail` before bumping.
- **Deleting scans cascades** — `scans→vulnerabilities` and `scans→scan_hosts` are `ON DELETE CASCADE`, but `vulnerabilities→tickets.vulnerability_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`. So `DELETE FROM scans WHERE id IN (...)` removes vulns and host scope rows but leaves orphan tickets with `vulnerability_id = NULL` (heals on the next scan that touches them). Verify with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE vulnerability_id IS NULL` before/after.
