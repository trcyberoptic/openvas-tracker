## 2025-05-06 - Prevent Timing Attacks in Password Comparison
**Vulnerability:** The application used a simple string comparison (`==`) for checking the admin password. This could allow an attacker to perform a timing attack to guess the password byte-by-byte.
**Learning:** Hardcoded direct string comparisons for sensitive data like passwords or tokens create timing side-channels.
**Prevention:** Always use constant-time comparison functions like `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` when comparing sensitive strings or byte slices to prevent timing attacks.

## 2025-05-17 - Prevent Length-Based Timing Attacks in ConstantTimeCompare
**Vulnerability:** Even when using `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, an early return based on unequal slice lengths can leak information about the expected length of a sensitive string (like a password or API key).
**Learning:** `ConstantTimeCompare` performs a constant-time comparison *only* if the lengths match. If lengths differ, it immediately returns 0. This creates a timing leak that reveals the target string length.
**Prevention:** Hash both strings (e.g. using `sha256.Sum256`) before passing them to `ConstantTimeCompare`. This ensures both inputs always have the same length (e.g. 32 bytes) regardless of the original string lengths.

## 2025-06-05 - Enforce Struct Validation Tags in Echo Handlers
**Vulnerability:** The application used `c.Bind(&req)` to bind incoming JSON requests to structs but failed to subsequently call `c.Validate(&req)`. Because `c.Bind()` alone does not enforce `validate:"required"` tags, attackers could submit incomplete or malformed payloads without being rejected by validation rules, potentially leading to logic errors or unauthorized behaviors.
**Learning:** In the Echo framework, binding and validation are separate steps. `c.Bind()` does not automatically invoke validation logic based on struct tags.
**Prevention:** Always pair `c.Bind(&req)` with an explicit `c.Validate(&req)` (or `c.Validate(req)`) call to ensure that payload constraints and required fields are correctly enforced.

## 2025-10-24 - Unnecessary Middleware Enforcement
**Vulnerability:** N/A (Hallucinated finding)
**Learning:** The project uses equal-access by design as outlined in `CLAUDE.md`. The `RequireRole` middleware exists but is intentionally wired to zero routes to bypass role enforcement. Assuming an RBAC model when the project doesn't implement one leads to obsolete or unnecessary work.
**Prevention:** Do not enforce `RequireRole` middleware automatically. Always verify against architecture/design instructions like `CLAUDE.md` to ensure a vulnerability is actually present and not an intentional design choice.
