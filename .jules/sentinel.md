## 2025-05-06 - Prevent Timing Attacks in Password Comparison
**Vulnerability:** The application used a simple string comparison (`==`) for checking the admin password. This could allow an attacker to perform a timing attack to guess the password byte-by-byte.
**Learning:** Hardcoded direct string comparisons for sensitive data like passwords or tokens create timing side-channels.
**Prevention:** Always use constant-time comparison functions like `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` when comparing sensitive strings or byte slices to prevent timing attacks.
